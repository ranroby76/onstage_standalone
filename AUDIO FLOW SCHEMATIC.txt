Here’s a detailed **text-based audio signal flow document** describing the schematic you provided:

# 🎛️ OnStage Vocal + Backing Audio Flow

*(Flowstone schematic interpretation – based on “Screenshot_11.jpg”)*

---

## 🔹 1. Input Stage

### MIC 1 and MIC 2

* Each mic input passes through its own **EQ** and **Compressor** module.
* Both EQs shape tonal balance (HPF, presence boost, low-cut, etc.).
* The compressors control vocal dynamics individually before any global effects.

---

## 🔹 2. Vocal FX Chain

After the per-mic compressors, both signals feed a shared **FX processing chain**:

1. **Harmonizer** – Adds pitch-shifted harmonies or doubling.
2. **Reverb** – Adds spatial ambience; stereo wet mix output.
3. **Delay** – Provides echo/repeat effect.

All three modules output to a **side-chain stage** for controlled ducking relative to the backing track.

## 🔹 3. Backing Sources

### a. Media Player

* Plays the main backing track or audio media file.
* Has its own **Media Volume** control before entering the master bus.

### b. “6 Backing Track Inputs with L/R Option”

* Accepts up to six separate stereo inputs (e.g., stems or multitrack playback).
* Each track can be summed or routed left/right individually.
* These signals also go toward the **side-chain compressor** for ducking interaction.

---

## 🔹 4. Side-Chaining and Dynamics Control

### Side-Chaining Compressor

* **Audio Inputs (blue)**: receive the combined processed vocal signal (post-delay).
* **Side-chain Inputs (green)**: receive signal from Media Player + Backing Tracks.
* Function: lowers the vocal FX output level when backing audio is strong — maintaining vocal clarity.
* Output of this compressor continues to the **Master Bus**.

---

## 🔹 5. Master Section

### Master Bus

* Combines all processed signals (vocals, harmonized FX, media/backing).
* Provides final **Recording Level** control.
* Sends parallel feeds to:

  * **Main Out** (for live PA or speakers)
  * **Audio Meters** (for monitoring)
  * **Recorder** (for capturing the final mix)

---

## 🔹 6. Monitoring & Output

* **Main Out** → System audio output / live monitoring chain.
* **Audio Meters** → Real-time visual metering of output levels.
* **Recorder** → Captures post-master mix for storage or broadcast.

---

## 🔹 7. Signal Flow Summary

**MIC 1/2 → EQ → Compressor → (merge) → Harmonizer → Reverb → Delay → Side-Chaining Compressor → Master Bus → Main Out / Meters / Recorder**

**MEDIA PLAYER + BACKING TRACKS → (Side-chain inputs to Compressor) → Master Bus → Main Out / Meters / Recorder**

---

## 🔹 8. Functional Overview

* **Blue paths** = primary audio routing.
* **Green paths** = side-chain control lines.
* **Goal:** Vocal signal is dynamically balanced against the backing tracks via side-chain compression while passing through tonal and spatial processing before final output.
