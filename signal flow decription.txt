signal flow: the 2 mic inputs which start as mono, connect each to their own dedicated stereo eq -> comp . the connection to the stereo eq (the first station of the signal) done  by connecting the mono signal of the mic to both L and R inputs of the eq and converting it to an actual stereo.  then, the signal flows through the stereo compressor and from there to the rest of the stereo fx chain: eravox -> harmonizer -> reverb -> delay -> master hub. also from the delay, additional stereo output goes to the the dynamic eq's sidechaning inputs to duck the backing track. the backing track is a sum of the media player's stereo outputs + 4 additional audio interface's input's outputs (paired in to stereo outputs). all those are passed through the dynamic eq's audio stereo inputs. after ducked and processed, they go to the master hub as stereo outputs and combined with the wet mics path outputs through stereo. from the master hub 3 pairs of output get connected in parallel to the recorder (did developed yet), audio meters and master outputs.
