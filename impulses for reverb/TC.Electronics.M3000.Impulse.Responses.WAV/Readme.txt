TC Electronics M3000 Impulse / Responses 

M3000 

The VSS3-reverb technology inherent in the M3000 is an industry standard. The M3000 has some of the best sounding, most versatile and easy-to-use 
professional reverbs for music and film/post applications. Combining ultimate 
control of directivity in the early reflections with a transparent and harmonically 
magnificent diffused field, the art of reverberation is brought to a new and higher level. 

The M3000 enables you to add the softest and cleanest ambience to your work that you 
have ever heard. Furthermore the processor boasts a wide range of tools and presets to 
give you the exact vintage or post production reverb you are looking for.
